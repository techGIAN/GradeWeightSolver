# GradeWeightSolver
A short tutorial of performing Linear Regression in R by determining the weights of grade requirements of students towards the overall grade

## The Scenario
I have thought of beginning a series, writing blogs for my <a href="http://galix.me/tech-blogz/tech.html" target="_blank">Tech-Blogz</a>, particularly on anything Machine Learning, Data Science, Analytics, etc. It could be tutorials, tricks, tips, thoughts and experiences or basically anything in between. So today I have thought of writing a basic tutorial for performing simple linear regression in R.

As a TA, I easily have connections with different professors and faculty members in our Computer Science department at our university at York. I was able to connect with one of my closest professors, and I asked for a little help from him, to provide his students' grades for a particular course. I would not be mentioning which professor is this and for what course and which academic session it is, but we will be using the <b>grades.xlsx</b> dataset, credits to the anonymous professor who has provided the dataset (does not wish to be named). Also names, student IDs and emails of students were removed for privacy reasons.
